      <description>On why many intellectual jobs are pretend jobs, why pretend work is actually a valid way of assessing real work, ponzi schemes and imposed structure.
Graduate recruiters &amp;amp; Team JUST When I arrived at Cambridge in 2011 I was immediately approached by hordes of corporates trying to sell me (a clueless teenager) a vision of what I should do after university. Law firms, investment banks and consultancies spend a large amount of money getting clueless students to go to career events.</description>

      <description>Ira wakes up craving some eggs for breakfast. She walks under the strong Cuban sun and visits the food market . She’s lucky: they have eggs today.
“How much for the box?” she asks, pointing at the box of 30 eggs.
“Four pesos”
She looks in her purse and finds a 100 peso note. She hands the note to the seller, who nods and hands her the eggs. She leaves without getting any change, nor did she expect to.</description>

      <description>As I write this, a novel strain of coronavirus (colloquially known as the rona) has a global lockdown. Unemployment rates are skyrocketing, the stock market has dropped substantially, but not nearly as much as consumer sentiment. Millions of businesses around the world, from small businesses like nail salons to tech giants like Airbnb are now facing the same problem: no revenues. At this point, we can only guess how long lockdowns will last.</description>

      <description>As a small business owner keeping track of things can be surprisingly difficult: how you spend your money, who owes you money, who you owe money, what are your expenses, margins, operating costs&amp;hellip;
If you have multiple revenue streams from multiple platforms, you can quickly reach a point where you ignore basic things, like for example how much you are making exactly. Specially when you are focused on numerous other things as you try to scale your business.</description>

      <description>In July of 2017 President Trump announced with much fanfare a new policy towards Cuba. This was following the Obama administrations &amp;ldquo;thaw&amp;rdquo; in Cuban-American bilateral relations, which had lead to a noticable rise in Americas visiting the island. Then more bad news for the Cuban tourism industry:
 sonic warfare in the news hurricanes  All of this together had a noticable impact on the Cuban tourism sector. Official Cuban statistics show that tourism numbers are going up.</description>

      <description>I spent a lot of time this year on the road. I started 2018 on a tropical beach in the Phillipines and ended it in Lisbon, with a lot of trips in between. Given that I spent a good part of this year playing around with maps for my thesis, I thought it would be fun to use my Google Location Services data to animate my movement this year. Here is the result:</description>

      <title>A smart email &amp; SMS bot on AWS using R</title>

      <description>I face the following problem: I get a lot of similarly formatted emails that require some sort of action that can in theory be easily automated. For example, I get Woocommerce order notifications that I want to forward selectively to my team via SMS.
It turns out there is no Gmail extension that will help you do that (or at least I didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything like it). A better programmer would alter the php code of the Woocommerce site to interact with the API of a service like SMSGLOBAL.</description>

      <guid>http://boazsobrado.com/blog/2018/09/02/a-tale-of-two-johns/</guid>
      <description>There has recently been a flurry of articles with a nice soundbite recycled from 2015. The title of the Observer&amp;rsquo;s version of the article is:
Men Named John Outnumber All Women in Most American Industries.
The New York Times writes:
 Fewer Republican senators are women than men named John — despite the fact that Johns represent 3.3 percent of the male population, while women represent 50.8 percent of the total population.</description>

      <title>How to generate a Bitcoin vanity address using a Mac</title>

      <guid>http://boazsobrado.com/blog/2018/08/11/how-to-generate-a-bitcoin-vanity-address-using-a-mac/</guid>
      <description>A bitcoin vanity address is an address that starts in a particular way. Here is an example:
My BTC address is 1Cobra3fJstD9g3DJ2oaUpDps5gJsZa4eS and my PGP key fingerprint is 61559B1EEFB3F8DA6C40BAAC6F85594478CE4C7A.
&amp;mdash; Cøbra (@CobraBitcoin) January 3, 2018 
Once I saw these addresses exist, I obviously wanted one. There are many websites that help you generate a vanity address, however it involves a trusted third party. Nick Szabo doesn&amp;rsquo;t like trusted third parties.</description>

      <description>In the second half of 2015, about a year after finishing my undergradate degree, after spending six months in working in Burma for Rocket Internet, I was unsure of what to do with myself. One of the default options (for people like me) is to go into further education, which meant getting a graduate degree. This was something encouraged by both my parents and some (but not all) friends. I was unsure whether I wanted it, so I wrote down my own motivations for doing so:</description>

      <title>Leaflet timeline in R</title>

      <guid>http://boazsobrado.com/blog/2018/02/08/leaflet-timeline-in-r/</guid>
      <description>Leaflet is a powerful tool for visualasing spatial data in R. However, after much googling I could not find an easy way to create a timeline to visualise changes in time. Therefore, I decided to create a simple shiny app that does it.
Raw Android GPS Movements Code The code below takes raw location measurements from my Android phone visualises them over time. The size of the circle is the confidence interval of the measurement.</description>

      <title>Time Series analysis for Facebook message volume</title>

      <guid>http://boazsobrado.com/blog/2017/12/01/time-series-analysis-for-facebook-message-volume/</guid>
      <description>Introduction to the data set The data is the amount of Facebook messages a user (me) sent and received between 2011 and 2016. The data was exported from Facebook, converted from HTML to JSON and subsequently read into R. For more details on how this was done, please consult here.
The original data source contains 413,101 timestamps and messages between 2008 and 2016. The volume of messages is very low between 2008-2011, and highly atypical to the rest of the series, so it was not considered in the sample.</description>

      <description>For the last year I have been helping people in Cuba sell tourism services online. In practice, this usually means creating accomodation listings on sites like Airbnb, messaging the guests and making sure the money gets to the hosts. About six months into doing this, I discovered a tool called Guesty which made things considerably easier (more on this in a bit).
In September due to Hurricane Irma came. Most guests cancelled their reservations.</description>

      <description>One of the first things a traveller notices when going to Costa Rica is that almost every town or city is named after a Saint. Growing up in Costa Rica, I just assumed this was something true of all Latin American countries, a legacy of Spanish colonial times. California has San Jose, San Fransisco, etc. I thought it was like that from California to Argentina.
After some travelling in Latin America I realised this was simply not true.</description>

      <description>Oscar Wilde once wrote:
 “Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.”
 I bought a bus ticket from London to Rotterdam. I did this in order to save what effectively amounts to the price of a handful of beers in London prices. I needed to get to Budapest, and I already had a flight leaving from Rotterdam booked. I spent 8 excruciating hours on a bus from London Victoria to Rotterdam Centraal, to in Rotterdam at 5 am in a cold winter morning.</description>

      <description>This week I had an interesting conversation (as interesting as these conversations can get) about the use of spreadsheets in business. I am still a little bit surprised by how often they are used for things they are not really good for. Now, I don’t want to write about how there are better alternatives to spreadsheets. Instead, I’d like to illustrate how powerful non-spreadsheet tools are by describing a task I completed this week using R.</description>

      <description>It is a truism that we live in the information age, yet on a day to day basis we engage remarkably little with insights on the personal information we create. Sure, Netflix shows you films you want to see, Amazon offers books you want to buy and Facebook shows you pictures of cats with boobs or whatever it is you tend to click on, but explicit purpose of that is to get your money.</description>

      <description>Aviacion de Cubana There was no toilet paper on the Russian-made Antonov 158 plane which took me and 15 other passengers to Havana. The Cuban state airline, Cubana de Aviacion, clearly does not need have to meet profitability targets. Even the dry sandwich they served tasted of an iron curtain.
Not unlike the other living political museum of China, immigration and customs is relatively straightforward. If you had to guess the political system of a country based on the border control procedures you’d probably guess the United States is authoritarian.</description>

      <description>Theory As our activities are increasingly organised online – from business through voting to leisure time – knowing how to write (or even just understand) code is an increasingly coveted skill. Its benefits range wide; if you can code you will get a better job, improve your analytical skills, make work processes easier and cheaper.
These reasons led us – Dora and Boaz, authors of this article – to set up our websites as a means of learning and practising a bit of coding.</description>

      <description>The books I finished reading recently that I thought might be interesting to comment upon were Steven Pinker’s The better Angels of Our Nature, Mo Yan’s Big Breast’s and Wide Hips, Kapuscinski’s The Shadow of the Sun, Robert Mazur’s Infiltrator and David Maurer’s Big Con . Steven Pinker, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote a (way too long) book to argue the world is becoming less, not more violent. What about ISIS, Ukraine, gang warfare and mass shootings?</description>

      <description>Prediction markets have the Republican nomination for President of the USA going to billionaire reality TV host and megalomaniac Donald Trump. On the other side of the aisle, self-described socialist Sanders is making Hillary Clinton’s campaign sweat. This isn’t “politics as usual” for anyone except the writers of The Simpsons. According to the party decides theory (or at least my interpretation of Nate Silver’s interpretation) the party, as a loose coalition of opinion forming individuals, can heavily weigh in on who gets nominated.</description>

I do not expect to do justice to the arguments in the books (read a real book review if you want that), I&amp;rsquo;m just sharing the lessons I learned from them as a little exercise.</description>

      <description>I bought my Kindle slightly over a year ago, and since it has accompanied me everywhere I&amp;rsquo;ve been. It has provided me with entertainment on long journeys and education in subjects where I had none. I would like to share some of my favourite quotes. I have sorted them based on when I started reading them, with some slight editing.
December (2014) ﻿The Prince (Niccolò Machiavelli) Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse.</description>

      <description>This year has been an adventure. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on three continents, countless countries and dozens of cities. I thought it would be an interesting project to quantify it all by visualising on a map the places where I slept. This is the result: In case you are interested in how I did it you can find the code below. I was inspired by this blog post.

      <description>In September, images of anti-riot police in a standoff with desperate migrants were shown on television, inspiring many people to volunteer and even more people to chatter about the situation. Yet the problem with our handling of crises is that we often wait for one to happen before doing anything (even just notice something is amiss). Humans are vulnerable to overlooking gradual phenomena with no easily distinguishable onset. There is an ongoing global demographic transition and it will influence most shifts in the next 25 years, be it in politics, business or international relations.</description>

      <description>A few friends and I are involved in the Budapest public bicycle data science competition. As of right now we are in the top ten, although in all honesty, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really started yet. We signed a non-disclosure agreement, so I cannot really share any cool details. What I can share however, is the function I wrote in R to get calculate the distances and duration of bike trips using Google Maps&amp;rsquo; API.</description>

      <description>English orthography is a tricky topic. Most people learning English (and a great number of native speakers) are puzzled by a written language with an utter disregard for phonemic representation. It is therefore very worrying that individuals intuitively assume making orthographic mistakes is a sign of low intelligence or unprofessionalism. In this post we are going to show how we looked into the relationship of IQ and orthography using R.</description>

      <description>Startling new data show that emigration out of Hungary is at a 20-year record high and that many more Hungarians have seriously considered leaving Hungary to live, work, or study in another member state of the EU. But instead of speaking ominously about the potentially catastrophic consequences of such emigration trends for Hungary, it is useful to think of this increased mobility as a potentially positive phenomenon.
Geographic mobility is often an indicator of social mobility.</description>
